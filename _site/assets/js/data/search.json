    "content": "In early 2022, I acquired a pair of high-power binoculars—the Skymaster 25x100. They were so large that using them required a tripod for support, but they opened up an entirely new view of the night sky.One of the first objects that amazed me was the Beehive Cluster (M44). It was incredible to see so many stars packed into a formation that was completely invisible to the naked eye in my light-polluted Bortle 9 backyard. That experience sparked my curiosity and set me on a journey into astrophotography, wondering what other hidden wonders I could uncover.Soon after, I purchased my first telescope, the SV550 80/480mm apochromatic triplet from SvBony, along with a Sky-Watcher HEQ5 mount and a DSLR camera. The learning curve was steep, from setting up the telescope to overcoming light pollution, but I’ve come a long way in the past two years, gradually expanding my equipment and skills.I created this site to share my astrophotography journey and the tips and tricks I’ve learned along the way. Whether you’re just starting out or looking for solutions to common challenges, I hope you find this resource helpful.Thank you for visiting my site!"
